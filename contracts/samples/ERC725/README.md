## ERC-725 Resolver Implementation for ERC-1484

This is a sample implementation of ERC-725 being used as a resolver. This allows for users to create a 725 or import one to be linked to their EIN. All management is done through the 725 contract, but in a more robust system, this could be done through providers to help make 725 more user friendly.
